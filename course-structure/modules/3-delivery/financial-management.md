## Managing Your Agency Finances

Let's set up your financial management system right now. I'll show you exactly how to track, forecast, and grow your agency's profits.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Books
Open QuickBooks Online (or Wave if you're starting out). Create these exact accounts:

Income Categories:
• Client Retainers
• Project Fees
• Consulting Calls
• Training Programs

Project Costs:
• Team Hours × Rate
• Software Costs
• Ad Spend
• Other Expenses
• 20% Buffer

Monthly Costs:
• Fixed Costs
• Variable Costs
• Team Costs
• Tool Costs
• Buffer

Pricing Formula:
1. Total Costs × 3 = Minimum Price
2. Value Delivered × 10% = Value Price
3. Use higher of the two

Example:
Costs = $3,000
Minimum Price = $9,000
Value Delivered = $100,000
Value Price = $10,000
Final Price = $10,000

## Step 3: The Cash Flow System

Weekly Review:

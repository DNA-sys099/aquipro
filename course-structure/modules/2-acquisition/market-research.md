## Step 1: Initial Market Analysis
Let's start by identifying potential markets using Sam Ovens' proven 3M Framework.

1. Open a new spreadsheet
2. Create the following columns:
   ```
   A: Industry Name
   B: Annual Spending ($B)

4. For each industry:
   a. Google "[industry] market size 2024"

   c. Record the annual spending in column B
   d. Find the growth rate (Google "[industry] growth rate forecast")
   e. Record in column C

### 1.2 Client Value Assessment
For each industry in your spreadsheet:

1. Find average client value:
   a. Google "[industry] average client lifetime value"

2. Score each industry (Column E):
   - 10 points: >$50k average client value
   - 8 points: $20k-$50k
   - 5 points: $10k-$20k
   - 0 points: <$10k

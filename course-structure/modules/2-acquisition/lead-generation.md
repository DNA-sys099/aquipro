# Getting Leads On Autopilot

Let's set up your lead generation system right now. I'll show you exactly how to get leads coming in daily without spending hours prospecting.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Lead Magnet
Open Google Docs right now. We're going to create a lead magnet that actually converts.

Title it:
"[Number] [Niche] [Result] Templates"

Examples:
"7 Email Templates That Get SaaS CEOs to Reply"
"5 Ad Templates That Get Real Estate Leads for $5"
"3 Automation Scripts That Save E-commerce Stores 10 Hours/Week"

Don't use: "Free Guide" or "Strategy Session"

## Step 2: Creating Your Lead Magnet
Copy this exact structure:

Page 1: The Promise
"These templates helped [specific result]. Example: Generated 127 leads in 30 days for [niche] business"

Page 2-4: The Templates
For each template:
1. When to use it
2. Why it works
3. The exact template
4. How to customize it

Last Page: Your Call-to-Action
"Want help implementing these? Book a call here: [calendar link]"

## Step 3: Setting Up Your Landing Page
Go to Carrd.co right now (it's free and super easy).

Your headline should be:
"Get [specific result] for your [niche] business in [timeframe]"

Example:
"Get 30+ Qualified Leads for Your SaaS Company in 14 Days"

Under that, write:
"Download these proven templates:
• Template 1: [specific result]
• Template 2: [specific result]
• Template 3: [specific result]"

Example:
"Download these proven templates:
• Cold Email Template: 72% open rate
• LinkedIn Message: 65% response rate
• Follow-up Sequence: 38% meeting rate"

## Step 4: Setting Up Your Ad

Objective: Lead Generation
Budget: $20/day
Audience:
- Location: Your target location
- Age: 28-55

Create 5 emails:

Email 1: Welcome
Subject: "Here are your [niche] templates!"

## Step 6: Daily Management
Every morning, do this:

9:00-9:15: Check new leads
- Download lead list
- Import to your CRM
- Start email sequence

9:15-9:30: Check ad performance
- Cost per lead
- Click rate
- Landing page conversion

9:30-10:00: Optimize

- Test new headlines if CTR < 1%
- Update landing page if conversion < 20%

## Step 7: Scaling Up
When your cost per lead is under $20 and you're converting at least 10% to calls:

1. Duplicate your best ad
2. Increase budget by $10/day

# Creating An Irresistible Offer

Let's create an offer that makes your clients say "I need this!" I'll show you exactly how to package and price your services to get easy "yes" decisions.

## Step 1: Naming Your Service
Open a new doc. We're going to create a name that instantly communicates value.

Use this formula:
"The [Timeframe] [Result] [System/Method/Framework]"

Examples:
"The 90-Day Client Acquisition System"
"The 60-Day Traffic Transformation Method"
"The 30-Day Lead Generation Framework"

Don't use: "Consulting" or "Coaching" or "Package"

## Step 2: Creating Your Value Stack
List out everything your client gets. But here's the trick - we're going to stack the value.

Write down:
1. Core Service
Example: "12-Week Facebook Ads Management"
Value: $3,000/month

2. Strategy Calls
Example: "Weekly 30-min Strategy Calls"
Value: $500/week

3. Template Package
Example: "High-Converting Ad Templates"
Value: $997

4. Bonus 1
Example: "Email Follow-up Sequence"
Value: $1,997

5. Bonus 2
Example: "Landing Page Templates"
Value: $997

Total Value: $15,988

## Step 3: Pricing Your Offer
Take your monthly delivery cost and multiply by 5.

Example:
Your cost: $1,000/month
Charge: $5,000/month

If you're just starting:
1. Find 3 competitors
2. Take their average price
3. Subtract 20%

Example:
Competitor A: $6,000/month
Competitor B: $4,000/month
Competitor C: $5,000/month
Average: $5,000/month
Your price: $4,000/month

## Step 4: Creating Your Guarantee
Use this formula:
"Get [specific result] in [timeframe] or [benefit]"

Examples:
"Get 30 qualified leads in 60 days or get month 3 free"
"Book 10 sales calls in 30 days or we'll run your ads for free"
"Increase conversions by 50% in 90 days or pay nothing"

Don't use: "Satisfaction guaranteed" or "Money back guarantee"

## Step 5: Writing Your Offer Page
Open Google Docs. Create your offer page with exactly this structure:

1. The Promise (Top of Page)
"Get [specific result] in [timeframe] without [pain point]"

Example:
"Get 30+ Qualified Leads Every Month Without Spending Hours on Cold Outreach"

2. The Problem (Next Section)
"Right now, you're probably:
• [Problem 1]
• [Problem 2]
• [Problem 3]"

Example:
"Right now, you're probably:
• Spending hours on LinkedIn trying to find leads
• Getting ignored by potential clients
• Wasting money on ads that don't convert"

3. The Solution (Middle Section)
"Introducing [Your Offer Name]:
• [Benefit 1]
• [Benefit 2]
• [Benefit 3]"

4. The Process (Next Section)
"Here's how it works:
Week 1: [Action/Result]
Week 2: [Action/Result]
Week 3: [Action/Result]
Week 4: [Action/Result]"

5. The Value Stack (Bottom Section)
"Here's everything you get:
 Core Service ($X value)
 Component 2 ($X value)
 Component 3 ($X value)
 Bonus 1 ($X value)
 Bonus 2 ($X value)

Total Value: $X
Your Investment: $Y"

## Step 6: Creating Your Pitch Deck
Open Google Slides. Create 12 slides exactly like this:

Slide 1: The Promise
Your offer name + main result

Slide 2: About You
Quick credibility (2-3 bullets)

Slides 3-5: The Problem
One problem per slide

Slides 6-8: The Solution
Your process, step by step

Slides 9-10: The Results
Specific outcomes clients can expect

Slide 11: The Offer
Full value stack + price

Slide 12: The Guarantee
Your specific guarantee

## Step 7: Testing Your Offer
Send this message to 5 past clients or potential clients:

"Hey [name]! Quick question - I'm launching a new [service type] that helps [niche] get [result] in [timeframe].

# Getting Clients Fast

Hey! Let's get you some clients right now. I'm going to show you exactly what to do, what to say, and how to respond. Ready?

## Step 1: Setting Up Your LinkedIn
Open up LinkedIn right now. Click on your profile. See where it says "Edit" next to your headline? Click that.

Your current headline probably says something like "Founder at [Your Company]" or "Marketing Expert". Let's fix that.

Type this instead:
"I help [niche] get [result] through [service]"

For example:
‚ùå "Facebook Ads Expert"
‚úÖ "I help real estate agents get 20+ leads/week through Facebook ads"

‚ùå "Email Marketing Specialist"
‚úÖ "I help ecommerce stores get 2x sales through email automation"

## Step 2: Finding People Who Need You
Go to LinkedIn right now. Type this in the search bar:
"CEO [your niche]"

See all those people? Those are your potential clients. But wait - don't message them yet!

Click "All Filters". Now check these boxes:
- Company Size: 11-50
- Posted Content: Last 30 days
- Location: [your country]

Perfect! These are people who:
1. Can afford your service
2. Are active on LinkedIn
3. Are decision makers

## Step 3: Sending Your First Message
Pick someone from your search. Look at their profile. Did they post something recently? Perfect.

Send them this:
"Hey [name]! Just read your post about [topic they posted about]. Completely agree with what you said about [specific point they made]. Would love to connect!"

For example:
‚ùå "Hey! Would love to connect!"
‚úÖ "Hey Mark! Just read your post about Facebook's iOS changes. Completely agree with what you said about first-party data being crucial now. Would love to connect!"

## Step 4: When They Accept
They accepted? Great! Wait 2 hours (set a timer), then send this:

"Thanks for connecting! Quick question - how are you handling [specific problem you solve] right now? 

The reason I ask is I noticed [something from their profile/posts] and thought I might be able to help."

Example:
‚ùå "Want to hop on a call to discuss how I can help?"
‚úÖ "Thanks for connecting! Quick question - how are you handling lead generation for your properties right now? 

The reason I ask is I noticed you're expanding into the Austin market and thought I might be able to help."

## Step 5: When They Reply
They'll usually say something like:
"We're using [current solution] but not getting great results"
or
"Not doing much with that right now"

Perfect! Now send:
"Got it. Would you be open to a quick chat where I can show you exactly how we get [specific result] for [their type of business]? No pressure at all - just want to see if I can help."

## Step 6: The Call
When you get on the call, start with:
"Before I talk about anything, tell me about your business - what are you working on right now?"

Then just listen. They'll tell you everything you need to know.

When they finish, ask:
"What made you interested in talking today?"

Then:
"What kind of results would you like to see in the next 90 days?"

## Step 7: Daily Action Plan
Every morning, do this:

9:00-9:20: Send 20 connection requests
Use the search filters we set up. Look at each person's profile for 30 seconds. Find something they posted or something interesting about their business to mention.

9:20-9:40: Follow up with yesterday's connections
Remember the template:
"Thanks for connecting! Quick question..."

9:40-10:00: Reply to any responses
Use the "Would you be open to a quick chat" template

## Need Clients Today?

   "Based on what you've shared, there are 3 core challenges:

   [Pause for 3-5 seconds]

3. Immediate Follow-up
   "Which of our payment options would work better for you:
    Option 1: [Pay in full, 10% discount]
    Option 2: [3-pay, standard rate]"
```

2. Objection Handling Matrix
```
Common Objections:
1. Price
   First Response: "I understand. Help me understand - is it the
   investment amount or the timing that's the bigger concern?"
   
   Follow-up:
   If Amount: ROI Calculation
   "Let's look at the numbers. You mentioned this is costing you
   [amount] per month. Our solution would cost [price], meaning
   you'd break even in [timeframe] and then profit [amount] every
   month after..."
   
   If Timing: Payment Plan
   "We have several flexible payment options. Would splitting this
   into [3/6/12] payments of [amount] make this more manageable?"

2. Need to Think About It
   First Response: "Of course, this is a significant decision.
   Help me understand - what specific aspects do you need to
   think through?"
   
   Follow-up:
   "Let's address each of those points now, so you have all the
   information you need to make a confident decision..."

3. Need to Discuss with Team/Partner
   First Response: "I completely understand. Who else needs to be
   involved in this decision?"
   
   Follow-up:
   "Would it be helpful if I joined a call with them to answer
   any questions directly?"

4. Not the Right Time
   First Response: "I understand timing is crucial. Help me
   understand what would make this the right time?"
   
   Follow-up:
   "What if we could start with [smaller commitment] to address
   [urgent need] while building toward the full solution?"
```

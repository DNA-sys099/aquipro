   [Pause for 3-5 seconds]

3. Immediate Follow-up
   "Which of our payment options would work better for you:
    Option 1: [Pay in full, 10% discount]
    Option 2: [3-pay, standard rate]"
```

2. Objection Handling Matrix
```
Common Objections:
1. Price
   First Response: "I understand. Help me understand - is it the
   investment amount or the timing that's the bigger concern?"
   
   Follow-up:
   If Amount: ROI Calculation
   "Let's look at the numbers. You mentioned this is costing you
   [amount] per month. Our solution would cost [price], meaning
   you'd break even in [timeframe] and then profit [amount] every
   month after..."
   
   If Timing: Payment Plan
   "We have several flexible payment options. Would splitting this
   into [3/6/12] payments of [amount] make this more manageable?"

2. Need to Think About It
   First Response: "Of course, this is a significant decision.
   Help me understand - what specific aspects do you need to
   think through?"
   
   Follow-up:
   "Let's address each of those points now, so you have all the
   information you need to make a confident decision..."

3. Need to Discuss with Team/Partner
   First Response: "I completely understand. Who else needs to be
   involved in this decision?"
   
   Follow-up:
   "Would it be helpful if I joined a call with them to answer
   any questions directly?"

4. Not the Right Time
   First Response: "I understand timing is crucial. Help me
   understand what would make this the right time?"
   
   Follow-up:

   [urgent need] while building toward the full solution?"

## Closing Deals Without Being Salesy

Hey! Let's get you closing deals confidently. I'm going to show you exactly what to say on calls, how to handle objections, and how to close without being pushy.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Call System
Open your calendar right now. Go to Calendly.com and create a free account.

Name your meeting type:
"[Your Niche] Strategy Session"

NOT:
❌ "Discovery Call"
❌ "Sales Call"
❌ "Free Consultation"

Set the duration to 30 minutes. Not 15 (too short), not 60 (too long).

## Step 2: The Pre-Call Process
When someone books a call, send them this message right away:

"Hey [name]! Looking forward to our chat on [day] at [time].

To make this super valuable for you, could you tell me:
1. What's your biggest challenge with [problem you solve] right now?
2. What have you tried so far?

Talk soon!"

## Step 3: Starting The Call
First 2 minutes:
"Hey [name]! Can you hear me okay?"
[Wait for response]

"Great! Before we dive in, I like to start all my calls by learning more about you and your business. Tell me what you're working on right now?"

[Let them talk]

❌ Don't say: "Let me tell you about what we do..."
✅ Do say: "Tell me more about that..."

## Step 4: Finding Their Pain
When they finish talking, ask these exact questions:

1. "What made you interested in talking today?"
[Let them answer]

2. "How long has this been a problem?"
[Let them answer]

3. "What happens if you don't fix this in the next 3-6 months?"
[Let them answer]

## Step 5: Presenting Your Solution
Only NOW do you talk about your solution. Say this:

"Based on what you've told me, there are 3 things we need to focus on:

1. [Problem they mentioned]
2. [Problem they mentioned]
3. [Problem they mentioned]

Would you like me to show you how we solve these?"

[Wait for them to say yes]

Then share your screen and show them:
1. Your process (simple flowchart)
2. Timeline (week by week)
3. Expected results (be specific)

## Step 6: Handling "The Price Question"
They'll ask: "How much is this?"

Say this exactly:
"Great question. Let me ask you this first - if we could solve [their biggest problem] in the next 90 days, what would that be worth to your business?"

They'll usually give you a number. Let's say they say "$100,000"

Then say:
"Okay, and if we could do that for less than [1/10th of their number], would that be worth exploring?"

## Step 7: Common Objections
Here's exactly what to say for each objection:

"I need to think about it"
Say: "I completely understand. What specific part do you need to think about?"

"It's too expensive"
Say: "I understand. Let me ask you - is it the investment that's the issue, or do you not see enough value in the results we discussed?"

"I need to talk to my partner/team"
Say: "Of course! What concerns do you think they'll have that I can address right now?"

"Can you send me more information?"
Say: "Happy to! What specific information would help you make a decision?"

## Step 8: Closing The Deal
When they're ready to move forward, say:

"Great! Here's what happens next:
1. I'll send you the agreement right now
2. Once you sign, you'll get our onboarding questionnaire
3. We'll schedule our kickoff call for next week
4. We can start implementing by [date]

Does that work for you?"

## Step 9: After They Say Yes
Send this exact email:

Subject: Welcome aboard [name]! Next steps

"Hey [name]!

Excited to have you on board! Here's what happens next:

1. Click here to sign the agreement: [DocuSign link]
2. Fill out our kickoff questionnaire: [Form link]
3. Book your kickoff call: [Calendly link]

Need anything else? Just hit reply!

[Your name]"

## What To Do Right Now
1. Set up your Calendly
2. Create your call structure in a Google Doc
3. Practice the questions out loud 3 times

Go do that now. Then come back and I'll show you how to handle your first call!

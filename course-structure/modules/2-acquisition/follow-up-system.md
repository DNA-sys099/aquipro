# Never Lose A Lead Again: Your Follow-Up System

Let's build your follow-up system right now. I'll show you exactly what to say and when to say it to convert more leads into clients.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your CRM
Open HubSpot (free version) right now. We're going to set up your pipeline.

Create these exact stages:
1. New Lead
2. First Contact
3. Discovery Call Booked
4. Proposal Sent
5. Contract Sent
6. Won/Lost

For each lead, track:
• Lead Source
• Last Contact Date
• Next Action
• Notes

## Step 2: Your First Response
When a new lead comes in, send this exact message within 5 minutes:

If from LinkedIn:
"Hey [name]! Thanks for connecting. I saw you're in [industry] - I help companies like yours [result]. Would you be open to a quick chat about how we could help you achieve [specific goal]?"

If from Website Form:
"Hey [name]! Just got your message about [their problem/request]. I help [niche] achieve [result] - would you be open to a quick chat about how we could help you with [specific goal]?"

If from Email:
"Hi [name], thanks for reaching out! I specialize in helping [niche] achieve [result]. I'd love to learn more about your goals for [their focus area]. Would you be open to a quick chat this week?"

## Step 3: The Follow-Up Sequence
Use this exact sequence for every lead:

Day 1 (5 min after first message):
"By the way, here's a quick case study of how we helped [company] achieve [result]: [link]"

Day 2:
"Hey [name], just wanted to make sure you saw my message. Would you be open to a quick chat this week?"

Day 4:
"Hi [name], I put together a quick video showing how we could help you achieve [result]: [loom video link]"

Day 7:
"[name], I noticed [something from their LinkedIn/website]. We recently helped a similar company achieve [result]. Would you be interested in learning how?"

Day 14:
"Hey [name], I'm following up one last time. We're helping companies like yours achieve [result] right now. If you'd like to learn how, just let me know!"

## Step 4: After The Discovery Call
Send these exact messages:

Same Day (Within 2 hours):
"Thanks for the great chat, [name]! As promised, here's:
1. [Resource you promised]
2. [Case study you mentioned]
3. [Link to book follow-up]

Let me know if you have any questions!"

Day 2 (If no response):
"Hey [name], just checking in to see if you had any questions about what we discussed? I'm happy to clarify anything!"

Day 4 (If no response):
"Hi [name], I was thinking about your situation with [specific problem they mentioned]. Here's a quick idea that might help: [specific suggestion]"

## Step 5: After Sending Proposal
Send these exact messages:

Same Day:
"[name], just sent over the proposal we discussed. I've included everything we talked about, plus a bonus [specific item] to help you get results even faster. Take a look and let me know if you have any questions!"

Day 2 (If no response):
"Hey [name], just floating this back to the top of your inbox. Would you like me to walk you through the proposal on a quick call?"

Day 4 (If no response):
"Hi [name], I know you're probably still reviewing the proposal. Just wanted to let you know that if we get started this week, we can [specific benefit/timeline]. Would you like to move forward?"

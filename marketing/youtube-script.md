## Intro (1 minute)
"What's up everyone! Today, I'm going to share the exact framework we use to scale agencies from zero to 7-figures. This isn't theory - this is the exact system we've implemented across multiple agencies, consistently generating predictable results.

But before we dive in, quick disclaimer: This is about 50% of our complete system. If you want the full framework, including our advanced automation and scaling tactics, check out the link in the description.

Let's get into it!

## The Problem with Most Agencies (2 minutes)
Most agencies struggle with three core problems:
1. Inconsistent lead generation
2. Poor positioning that makes them compete on price
3. Lack of systems that prevent scaling

Here's the truth: Running successful ads or ranking on Google isn't enough anymore. You need a complete system that works while you sleep.

## The Framework Overview (2 minutes)
Our framework has 10 core modules, but today we're going to focus on the four most critical ones:
1. Positioning Strategy
2. Authority Building
3. Lead Generation System
4. Value-Based Pricing

These four components alone can double or triple your agency's revenue when implemented correctly.

## Module 1: Positioning Strategy (4 minutes)
Let's start with positioning - this is where 90% of agencies get it wrong.

Instead of being a "full-service digital marketing agency", you need to become the go-to expert for a specific:
- Industry (e.g., SaaS companies, real estate)
- Problem (e.g., lead generation, brand building)
- Solution (e.g., LinkedIn marketing, video marketing)

Here's our three-step positioning process:
1. Market Research
   - Identify growing industries with money to spend
   - Look for underserved markets
   - Find markets with clear ROI potential

2. Specialization Matrix
   - Plot potential specializations on our matrix
   - Evaluate based on:
     * Market size
     * Competition level
     * Your expertise
     * Profit potential

3. Message Development
   - Create your "Only" statement
   - Example: "We're the only agency that helps SaaS companies generate demos through LinkedIn without paid ads"

## Module 2: Authority Building (4 minutes)
Once you have your positioning, you need to become the obvious choice in your market. Here's how:

1. Content Ecosystem

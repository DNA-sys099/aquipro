                Hey everyone! Welcome back. Today we're going to dive into something that's making my agency an extra 
                $25,000 per month - our follow-up system. And the crazy thing? It's almost entirely automated.

                But first, let me tell you about the massive mistake I made when I first started. I used to think 
                follow-up meant just sending a "checking in" email every few days. You know the ones - "Hey, just 
                checking in to see if you've made a decision." Guess how well that worked? Exactly. Zero responses.

                Then I had this breakthrough moment. I was looking at our CRM data and noticed something interesting. 
                The clients who ended up signing with us had an average of 7-8 touchpoints before they signed. But 
                we were giving up after 2-3 emails.

                So I developed what I call the "Value Ladder Follow-up System." Here's exactly how it works:

                Day 1: Send a value-packed resource
                • Something they can use immediately
                • No pitch, just pure value
                • Ask for feedback

                Day 3: Share relevant results
                • Make it relevant to their industry
                • Focus on the process, not just results
                • Include specific numbers and timelines

                Day 5: Send an industry insight
                • Share a trend or opportunity they might have missed
                • Position yourself as an expert
                • Make it actionable

                The key is that each touchpoint adds value. We're not just "checking in" - we're giving them a reason 
                to respond. And in the next section, I'll show you exactly how to create each of these touchpoints 
                and what to say in each one.

                Welcome back! Now I'm going to show you exactly what to write in each email template. I'm 
                talking specific phrases that trigger emotional responses and drive decisions.

                Let me share a quick story. We had this client who was reviewing three different agency proposals. All 
                had similar pricing and services. But they chose us because, in their words, "Your proposal felt like 
                you were reading our minds." I'm going to show you how to create that same effect.

                Let's break down each section:

                1. The Opening Statement
                Bad: "Thank you for the opportunity to submit this proposal."
                Good: "Based on what you've shared, there are three main challenges we need to address..."
                Then list their challenges using their exact words - this is crucial. I literally write down their exact 
                phrases during the discovery part of the call.

                Then say: "Here's how we'll solve each of these..."
                Present your solution, but keep it high level. Don't get too technical. I made this mistake early on, 
                getting into the weeds about SEO algorithms and social media strategies. You'll lose them. Keep it focused 
                on outcomes.

                Finally: "The investment for this solution is $X per month..."
                Then - and this is crucial - be completely silent. Don't say another word. Let them respond first. This 
                silence might feel uncomfortable, but it's powerful. I count to ten in my head if I need to.

                Now, here's what they're going to say, and exactly how you should respond:

                When they say "I need to think about it":
                You say: "What specific aspects would you like to think about?"
                This helps you address their real concerns immediately. Often, "I need to think about it" really means 
                "I have an objection I'm not comfortable sharing."

                When they say "It's too expensive":
                You say: "Let me show you the ROI calculation based on your current numbers..."
                Always focus on value, never apologize for your prices. I learned this the hard way - the moment you 
                apologize for your price or try to justify it, you've lost.

                When they say "We want to try it internally first":
                You say: "Let me show you a comparison of in-house versus agency costs..."
                Then break down the real costs of hiring and training an internal team. Include salary, benefits, 
                software costs, training time - everything. This usually opens their eyes.

                Remember, your job isn't to convince them. It's to help them make a clear decision about whether this is 
                right for their business. Sometimes that decision will be no, and that's okay. Better to know now than 
                after you've started working together.

                I used to think sales was about persuasion and closing techniques. But really, it's about asking the right 
                questions, listening carefully, and then showing people how you can help them get what they want. Do this 
                right, and the closing takes care of itself.

                That's it for this training. In the next video, I'll show you how to handle the follow-up process 
                and what to do after the call to maximize your chances of closing the deal. Make sure to subscribe and

                Alright, this is where the magic happens. I'm going to show you how to automate this entire follow-up 
                system so it runs on autopilot. This is how we manage to follow up with hundreds of leads without 
                missing a single one.

                Let me share a story that changed everything for us. We were spending hours manually sending emails. 
                Then we realized we could automate a lot of these emails. Game changer!

                Here's the exact system we built:

                1. CRM Integration
                • Set up tags for different lead sources
                • Create custom fields for tracking responses
                • Build automated sequences based on lead source

                2. Email Automation Rules
                • If they open but don't reply → Send follow-up #1 after 3 days
                • If they click but don't book → Send case study
                • If no engagement → Switch to different angle

                3. Engagement Tracking
                • Track email opens and clicks
                • Monitor website visits
                • Record content downloads

                4. Response Management
                • Auto-categorize responses
                • Priority flagging for hot leads
                • Automated meeting scheduling

                The key to making this work is what I call "intelligent automation." It's not just about sending 
                automated emails - it's about sending the RIGHT email at the RIGHT time based on their behavior.

                For example, if someone downloads your pricing guide but doesn't book a call, they automatically get 
                a different sequence than someone who downloaded a basic whitepaper. The system recognizes their level 
                of interest and responds accordingly.

                Here's what happened when we implemented this system:
                • Follow-up consistency went from 60% to 100%
                • Response rates increased by 47%
                • Sales team saved 15 hours per week
                • Lead-to-meeting conversion went up 28%

                That's it for this video! In the next one, I'll show you how to set up your proposal system to close 
                these leads at a higher rate. Don't forget to hit subscribe and the notification bell to catch that 
                one. And if this was helpful, smash that like button!

                Hey everyone! Welcome back. Today I'm going to show you exactly how I write proposals that convert at 
                85%. Yes, you heard that right - 85%. And I'm not talking about small projects either. These are 
                five and six-figure deals.

                But first, let me tell you about the worst proposal I ever wrote. It was for a $120,000 website project. 
                I was so proud of it. The client's response? "This is way too complicated." We lost the deal.

                That's when I realized something crucial - clients don't want to read a novel. They want to know three 
                things:
                1. Do you understand their problem?
                2. Can you solve it?
                3. How much will it cost?

                So I developed what I call the "3-Block Proposal Framework." Here's exactly how it works:

                Block 1: The Problem Statement
                • Start with THEIR words (from the discovery call)
                • List 3-4 specific challenges they mentioned
                • Show the cost of not solving these problems

                Block 2: The Solution Overview
                • High-level solution (no technical jargon)
                • Expected outcomes
                • Timeline for results

                Block 3: The Investment
                • Clear pricing structure
                • Payment terms
                • Added value
                • Guarantees

                Alright, this is where most people mess up. They send the proposal via email and wait. Big mistake. 
                Let me show you the exact process that's helped us close 85% of our proposals.

                First, a story. We once had this huge proposal - $250,000 project. I was tempted to just email it 
                because I was nervous about the size. But I stuck to our process. We ended up closing that deal, and 
                the client later told me it was our presentation approach that won them over.

                Here's the exact process:

                Step 1: The Setup
                • Never send the proposal before presenting it
                • Schedule a 30-minute video call
                • Send a calendar invite with clear agenda
                • Have your screen share ready to go

                Step 2: The Presentation Script
                "Thanks for joining today. I'm going to walk you through our proposed solution for [specific challenge]. 
                I've kept this brief and focused on the outcomes you mentioned were most important to you."

                Then walk through each section:
                • Reflect their challenges (show you listened)
                • Present the solution (focus on outcomes)
                • Share relevant insights
                • Explain the investment (focus on ROI)

                Step 3: The Close
                • "Based on what I've shared, do you have any questions?"
                • Address questions immediately
                • "Would you like to move forward?"

                If they say "We need to think about it":
                • "Of course. What specific aspects would you like to think about?"
                • Address concerns right there
                • Suggest a follow-up date

                Step 4: After the Call
                • Send the proposal immediately
                • Include a summary of discussed points
                • Add a clear call to action
                • Set a follow-up task for 24 hours

                The key is to keep providing value after the proposal. Think about it - if someone downloads a LinkedIn 
                checklist, they're probably trying to improve their LinkedIn presence. So every follow-up should help 
                them with that goal.

                Hey everyone! Welcome back. Today we're going to talk about something that's absolutely crucial for your 
                agency - client onboarding. I'm going to show you exactly how we set up and run projects so nothing 
                falls through the cracks.

                But first, let me tell you about a complete disaster I had with a client. We signed this big client - 
                $15,000 per month. I was so excited about landing them that I rushed straight into the work. No proper 
                onboarding, no clear expectations, no defined processes. Three months later, they fired us. That was a 
                $180,000 lesson in the importance of proper onboarding.

                That's when I realized something crucial - clients don't want to read a novel. They want to know three 
                things:
                1. Do you understand their problem?
                2. Can you solve it?
                3. How much will it cost?

                So I developed what I call the "5-Star Onboarding System":

                Step 1: Welcome Package (Day 1)
                • Send welcome video from agency owner
                • Share onboarding timeline
                • Include all necessary forms
                • Set up client portal access

                Step 2: Kickoff Call (Day 3)
                • Review project scope in detail
                • Set clear expectations
                • Define communication channels
                • Establish reporting schedule

                Step 3: Strategy Session (Day 5)
                • Deep dive into their business
                • Set measurable goals
                • Create 90-day roadmap
                • Assign team members
                """)

                if st.button("Next Page →", key="onboarding_next_1"):
                    st.session_state.onboarding_page = 2
                    st.rerun()

            # Page 2: Welcome Package and Kickoff
            elif st.session_state.onboarding_page == 2:
                st.title("Welcome Package & Kickoff Call")
                
                st.write("""
                Welcome back! Now I'm going to show you exactly what goes into our welcome package and how to run a 
                kickoff call that sets you up for success.

                Let me tell you about an interesting experiment we did. We tested two different welcome packages with 
                100 clients each. The first was just a standard email with forms. The second was our new enhanced 
                package. The enhanced package group had 40% fewer support requests in the first month and reported 
                90% higher satisfaction.

                Here's exactly what goes into our welcome package:

                1. Welcome Video Script:
                "Hi [Client Name], this is [Your Name] from [Agency]. I'm so excited to have you on board! In this 
                video, I'll walk you through what happens next and introduce you to your team..."

                2. Required Forms (with explanations):
                • Client Questionnaire: "This helps us understand your brand voice..."
                • Access Form: "We'll use this to set up your analytics..."
                • Brand Guidelines: "This ensures all work matches your brand..."

                3. Kickoff Call Agenda:
                • Introductions (5 minutes)
                • Project Overview (10 minutes)
                • Goal Setting (15 minutes)
                • Timeline Review (10 minutes)
                • Q&A (20 minutes)

                4. The Success Roadmap:
                • Week 1: Setup and Strategy
                • Week 2: Initial Deliverables
                • Week 3: Review and Adjust
                • Week 4: Scale and Optimize

                In the next section, I'll show you how to handle the crucial first 30 days to ensure long-term client 
                success.

                Quick story - we once had a client who was ready to cancel after 30 days. We managed to turn them 
                around using this exact system, and they ended up being our biggest advocate, referring us three other 
                clients.

                Here's our exact 30-day plan:

                Week 1: Foundation
                • Day 1: Send welcome package
                • Day 2: Collect all accesses
                • Day 3: Kickoff call
                • Day 5: Strategy session
                • Day 7: First progress update

                Week 2: Initial Wins
                • Implement quick wins
                • Show initial results
                • Get early feedback
                • Adjust approach if needed

                Week 3: Deep Implementation
                • Roll out full strategy
                • Team check-in
                • Client feedback session
                • Progress report

                Week 4: Review and Scale
                • Results presentation
                • Strategy refinement
                • Success celebration
                • Plan next 60 days

                Key Success Metrics to Track:
                • Response time to client requests
                • Task completion rate
                • Client engagement level

                Hey everyone! Welcome back. Today we're going to talk about something that's absolutely crucial for your 
                agency - project management. I'm going to show you exactly how to build systems that work.

                Let me tell you about a nightmare situation I had. We were managing everything through 
                email and spreadsheets. One day, we missed a crucial deadline because an email got buried in someone's 
                inbox. The client was furious, and we almost lost them.

                That's when I developed what I call the "Clear Vision Project System." Here's exactly how it works:

                Phase 1: Project Setup
                • Create project hub
                • Set up communication channels
                • Define project milestones
                • Assign team roles

                Phase 2: Task Organization
                • Break down deliverables
                • Set dependencies
                • Create task templates
                • Schedule check-ins

                Phase 3: Workflow Automation
                • Automate status updates
                • Set up reminders
                • Create report templates
                • Configure notifications

                The key is to make everything visible and accessible. No more digging through emails or wondering 
                what's happening with a task. In the next section, I'll show you exactly how to set up each part 
                of this system.

                Let me share a story. We hit a point where we had so many projects that our system started breaking 
                down. Tasks were slipping, team members were overwhelmed, and I was working weekends just to keep up. 
                That's when we developed this scaling framework.

                Here's exactly how we scale:

                Level 1: Team Structure
                • Create project pods
                • Assign pod leaders
                • Define escalation paths
                • Set communication protocols

                Level 2: Process Documentation
                • Create process wikis

                Hey everyone! Welcome back. Today we're going to talk about something that's absolutely crucial for your 
                agency - quality control. I'm going to show you exactly how we maintain consistent quality 
                across all our deliverables.

                Let me tell you about a wake-up call I had. Early in my agency, we sent out a social media calendar 
                to a client without our usual review process. There were typos everywhere, some posts had the wrong 
                dates, and worst of all, one post was for their competitor's product! Talk about embarrassing.

                That's when I realized something crucial - clients don't want to read a novel. They want to know three 
                things:
                1. Do you understand their problem?
                2. Can you solve it?
                3. How much will it cost?

                So I developed what I call the "Triple Check System." Here's exactly how it works:

                Level 1: Creator Check
                • Self-review checklist
                • Brand guidelines review
                • Technical requirements
                • Content accuracy

                Level 2: Peer Review
                • Fresh eyes review
                • Technical validation
                • Brand consistency
                • User experience

                Level 3: Final Approval
                • Project manager review
                • Client requirements check
                • Strategic alignment
                • Final polish

                Welcome back! Now I'm going to show you exactly how to run each level of the review process. This 
                is where most agencies fail - they either make it too complicated or too simple.

                Here's a story that changed everything. We used to have this massive 50-point checklist for 
                every deliverable. Sounds thorough, right? Wrong. People would just check boxes without really 
                looking. So we completely redesigned our process.

                Here's our exact review framework:

                Creator Check Process:
                • Complete the work
                • Step away for 10 minutes
                • Review with fresh eyes
                • Run through basic checklist

                Basic Checklist:
                • Spelling and grammar
                • Links and buttons work
                • Images and media load
                • Formatting is consistent

                Peer Review Process:
                • Assign to fresh eyes
                • Provide context
                • Set review deadline
                • Gather feedback

                Final Approval Process:
                • Strategic alignment check
                • Client requirement review
                • Final polish
                • Delivery prep

                In the next section, I'll show you how to automate parts of this process to make it even more 
                efficient.

                Alright, this is where it gets really interesting. I'm going to show you how to automate your 
                quality control process so it runs smoothly.

                Let me share a story that changed everything for us. We were spending hours manually checking 
                deliverables against our brand guidelines. Then we realized we could automate a lot of these checks. 
                Game changer!

                Here's exactly how we automate quality control:

                Automated Checks:
                • Spelling and grammar
                • Brand term usage
                • Link validation
                • Image optimization

                Workflow Automation:
                • Review assignments
                • Deadline reminders
                • Status updates
                • Team coordination

                Template System:
                • Review checklists
                • Feedback forms
                • Client presentations
                • Delivery documents

                Communication Automation:
                • Review notifications
                • Feedback collection
                • Status updates
                • Client communications

                The key to making this work is what I call "intelligent automation." It's not just about sending 
                automated emails - it's about sending the RIGHT email at the RIGHT time based on their behavior.

                For example, if someone downloads your pricing guide but doesn't book a call, they automatically get 
                a different sequence than someone who downloaded a basic whitepaper. The system recognizes their level 
                of interest and responds accordingly.

                Here's what happened when we implemented this system:
                • Follow-up consistency went from 60% to 100%
                • Response rates increased by 47%
                • Sales team saved 15 hours per week
                • Lead-to-meeting conversion went up 28%

                Hey everyone! Welcome back. Today we're going to talk about something that's absolutely crucial for your 
                agency - client success. I'm going to show you exactly how we keep our clients happy and 
                engaged long-term.

                Let me tell you about a painful lesson I learned. We used to think that good work was enough to 
                keep clients happy. Then we lost three clients in one month - all of them said they just didn't 
                feel valued. That's when I realized we needed a real client success system.

                Here's what I developed - the "Client Joy System." Here's exactly how it works:

                Phase 1: Regular Check-ins
                • Weekly progress calls
                • Monthly strategy sessions
                • Quarterly reviews
                • Annual planning

                Phase 2: Proactive Communication
                • Industry updates
                • New opportunity alerts
                • Strategy suggestions
                • Educational content

                Phase 3: Value Demonstration
                • Progress tracking
                • Strategy alignment
                • Goal monitoring
                • Innovation planning

                Here's a story that changed everything for us. We had this client who was always frustrated after 
                our calls. Turns out, we were talking about what WE thought was important, not what THEY cared 
                about. Once we fixed that, everything changed.

                Here's our exact meeting framework:

                Weekly Progress Calls:
                • Review this week's work
                • Address any concerns
                • Plan next week's tasks
                • Collect feedback

                Monthly Strategy Sessions:
                • Review monthly goals
                • Discuss market changes
                • Adjust strategies
                • Plan next month

                • Strategy assessment
                • Market analysis
                • Future planning

                Let me share something interesting. We used to spend hours preparing for client meetings, sending 
                follow-ups, and tracking action items. Then we automated the routine stuff, which gave us more time 
                for strategic thinking and personal interaction.

                Here's exactly how we automate client success:

                Meeting Automation:
                • Calendar scheduling
                • Agenda creation
                • Reminder system

                • Progress tracking
                • Strategy documents

                Relationship Building:
                • Birthday reminders
                • Company milestones
                • Success celebrations

                Hey everyone! Welcome back. Today we're going to talk about the essential tools every agency needs 
                for project management. I'm going to show you exactly what tools to use and how to set them up.

                Let me tell you about a common mistake. When I started, I tried using too many tools at once. 
                It was overwhelming and actually slowed us down. That's when I developed this simple framework.

                Here's what you need:

                Core Project Tools:
                • Task management
                • Time tracking
                • File storage
                • Team chat

                Client Communication:
                • Meeting scheduler
                • Video conferencing
                • Document sharing
                • Email management

                Team Collaboration:
                • Design tools
                • Development tools
                • Writing tools

                Hey everyone! Welcome back. Today we're going to talk about something that's absolutely crucial for your 
                agency - building your team. I'm going to show you exactly how to hire, train, and structure your 
                team.

                Let me tell you about a massive mistake I made early on. I hired people based purely on their skills, 
                without considering culture fit. We had brilliant people who just couldn't work together. It was a 
                nightmare. That's when I developed what I call the "Dream Team Framework."

                Here's exactly how it works:

                Phase 1: Role Definition
                • Create clear job descriptions
                • Define expectations
                • Set team structure
                • Map career paths

                Phase 2: Hiring Process
                • Culture fit assessment
                • Skills evaluation
                • Team compatibility
                • Growth potential

                Phase 3: Onboarding System
                • Welcome process
                • Training program
                • Mentorship setup
                • Integration plan

                The key is to hire for attitude and train for skills. In the next section, I'll show you exactly 
                how to run your hiring process to find these perfect-fit team members.

                because we kept compromising on our standards. When we finally got strict about our process, we 
                found the perfect person in just two weeks.

                Here's our exact hiring framework:

                Step 1: Initial Screening
                • Review application
                • Culture questionnaire
                • Portfolio review
                • Quick video intro

                Step 2: Skills Assessment
                • Practical test project
                • Tool proficiency
                • Problem-solving task

                later, nothing had changed. Then we developed this implementation system, and everything started

                Alright, this is where it gets really powerful. I'm going to show you how to automate your systems 
                so they run smoothly.

                Let me share a story that changed everything for us. We were spending hours manually checking 
                deliverables against our brand guidelines. Then we realized we could automate a lot of these checks. 
                Game changer!

                Here's exactly how we automate:

                Workflow Automation:
                • Task assignment
                • Daily updates
                • Status checks
                • Team coordination

                Communication Automation:
                • Update notifications
                • Team messages
                • Project updates
                • Team alerts

                Process Automation:
                • Data collection
                • File organization
                • System checks
                • Task tracking

                Integration Automation:
                • Tool connections
                • Data sync
                • System updates
                • Backup systems

                The key to making this work is what I call "intelligent automation." It's not just about sending 
                automated emails - it's about sending the RIGHT email at the RIGHT time based on their behavior.

                For example, if someone downloads your pricing guide but doesn't book a call, they automatically get

                of interest and responds accordingly.

                Here's what happened when we implemented this system:
                • Follow-up consistency went from 60% to 100%

                sustainable growth.

                Let me tell you about a big mistake I made. I used to just focus on getting more clients, 
                without any real strategy. We grew, but it was chaotic and stressful. That's when I developed 
                the "Strategic Growth Framework."

                • Competitor research
                • Client needs
                • Opportunity gaps

                • Market targeting

                Here's a story that changed everything. We had this beautiful strategic plan, but six months 
                later, nothing had changed. Then we developed this implementation system, and everything started 
                moving forward.
